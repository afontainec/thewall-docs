Welcome to the **Chinchay Docs of the Table Gateway Model**


The most fascinating and valuable piece of Chinchay it's the flexible TableGateway model. It handles all the interaction from and to a certain table in the database, without you knowing any sql! With it, you will easily be able to create, read, update, delete, count, sum and many other operations in the database, it's true, it's just that simple. If by any chance you are a sql master and want to go beyond, Chinchay will allow you and help you to organize your queries.


## Table Data Gateway

Other code calls it's methods for all interaction with the database. You can read more about [Table Data Gateway here](https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/tableDataGateway.html).
